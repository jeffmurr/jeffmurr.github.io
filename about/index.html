		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am relentlessly building on more than 15 years in information technology and business data systems leadership experience. I am currently the Director of Platform Engineering at MetLife, overseeing their global technology container and open-source strategy in Raleigh, NC. Throughout my career, I have been responsible for multi-million dollar engineering projects for Global Fortune 500 clients and lead a range of code development and software-on-demand functions. I regularly speak at industry conferences and host local meetups as an avid member of the technology community.
				
Outside of work, I am an active volunteer with Habitat for Humanity of North Carolina, helping to construct homes on a regular basis and assisting with operations at his local Habitat for Humanity ReStore. I also lead teams of volunteers with Junior Achievement of Eastern North Carolina to facilitate the organizationâ€™s annual fundraising events. Otherwise, I enjoy travel, running, and spending time with my wife and children.
